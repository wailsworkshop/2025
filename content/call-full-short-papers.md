## Introduction
The **2nd Workshop on Artificial Intelligence with and for Learning Sciences: Past, Present, and Future Horizons** 
(WAILS 2025) is a high-quality forum focused on achievements, challenges, solutions, and future perspectives concerned 
with the adoption of **artificial intelligence** methods and techniques in the context of **learning sciences**. Building on its 
successful inaugural edition, WAILS 2025 brings together researchers and practitioners working within academia, industry, and 
government, and coming from different fields such as computer science, education, cognitive science, economics, psychology, sociology, 
and human-computer interaction, with the goal of fostering a fruitful **dialogue across disciplines**. The accepted papers are going to be published by **Springer** into an **LNCS post-workshop proceedings volume**, and submitted for indexing to **DBLP**, **Google Scholar**, and **Scopus**. 

## Deadlines
- **Paper submission**: September 18, 2025
- **Notification**: October 23, 2025
- **Camera-ready submission**: November 6, 2025

Note: all the deadlines are at 11:59 pm [Anywhere on Earth (AoE)](https://time.is/Anywhere_on_Earth) time.

    - Explainability, transparency, and trust in educational AI
    - Fairness, bias mitigation, and inclusive design in AI applications
    - Privacy, data governance, and ethical data use in learning systems
    - Psychological and sociological effects of AI-mediated learning
    - Instructors engagement for the responsible usage of AI tools
    - Legal, policy, and institutional dimensions of AI adoption in education
- **Applications and emerging technologies**
    - Intelligent tutoring, coaching, and adaptive learning systems
    - Educational recommender systems and personalized learning pathways
    - Learning analytics for formative assessment and educational decision-making
    - Generative AI and large language models in educational contexts
    - AI applications for accessibility, multilingualism, and global education equity

## Submission 

### Platform

Papers must be written in **English** and submitted electronically in a **PDF format**, through the **CMT submission system**, by selecting the **type** “Full Paper" or "Short Paper” based on their length. The **link** to the submission system will be available soon. 

### Format

We encourage two types of submissions (reviewers will comment on whether the size is appropriate), in the Springer single-column format.
- **Full papers** (12 to 15 pages at most; references, figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgments, and any other content count toward the page limit) should report on substantial contributions. They should reflect innovations and have a thorough discussion of related work. 
- **Short papers** (6 to 11 pages at most; references, figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgments, and any other content count toward the page limit) discuss exciting new work that is not yet mature enough for a full paper – they report on a smaller or simpler-to-describe research work on some advances that can be described, set into context, and evaluated concisely.

### Templates

The authors should submit manuscripts for review in the **Springer single-column format**. Templates for authors are given below:
- [Latex](https://resource-cms.springernature.com/springer-cms/rest/v1/content/19238648/data/v8)
- [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/springer-lecture-notes-in-computer-science/kzwwpvhwnvfj)
- [Word](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://resource-cms.springernature.com/springer-cms/rest/v1/content/19238706/data/v5__;!!D9dNQwwGXtA!QassVui7ZN89lpQ-D7Y0u8JlGG89njKTrifZIdMWKXRkLszHuZKIFGLnmedhPj65oYOndDs5axD7BB3Xo9PVerEJD_woooW5_A$)

### Non-anonymity

Submissions will be reviewed under a **single-blind process**; thus, authors **are not required to anonymize** their manuscripts 
before uploading them.

### Non-dual policy 

There is **no dual submission policy**, which is why submitted manuscripts **must not** be simultaneously under review nor submitted for 
review elsewhere whilst under consideration for this workshop. A violation of this concurrent submission policy will be deemed a **serious 
infraction** of scientific ethics, and appropriate measures will be implemented in response.

### Ethical and human subjects considerations 

Submissions are expected to include a discussion of **ethical considerations**, as well as the **impact** of the presented work and/or its 
intended application, where appropriate. The authors are expected to comply with **ethical standards** and **regulatory guidelines** 
associated with **human subjects research**, including research involving human participants and research using personally identifiable data. 
Submissions reporting on such human subjects research must include a statement identifying any regulatory review the research is subject to or explaining the lack of required review.

## Review Process & Camera-Ready Submission 

### Review process

Reviewers will evaluate papers based on their **significance**, **originality**, **rigor**, and **contribution** to the field. 
Papers that are out of scope, incomplete, or lack sufficient evidence to support the basic claims, may be rejected without full review. 
Furthermore, reviewers will be asked to comment on **whether the length is appropriate** for the contribution. 

### Camera-ready information

The accepted papers will be submitted to the Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LCNS) and must be compliant with 
the guidelines provided by the LCNS. The accepted papers will be subject to further revision to **meet the requirements of the camera-ready 
format** required by Springer. We recommend the usage of LaTeX/Overleaf to minimize the extent of reformatting. Users of the Word template must use either the version 
for Microsoft Word for Windows, Macintosh Office 2011, or Macintosh Office 2016 (other formats like Open Office are not admitted) 
to avoid incompatibility issues. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers. In addition, the **corresponding author** of 
each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a consent-to-publish form. The corresponding author 
signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes 
relating to the authorship are not allowed. Instructions for preparing the camera-ready versions of accepted papers will be provided **after 
acceptance**. Camera-ready versions of accepted papers will be submitted via CMT. 

## Registration and Presentation Policy 

Each accepted paper must be accompanied by a **full author registration**, completed by the **early registration deadline**. 
Please kindly note that a single registration covers up to one paper accepted in the full or short paper track, and up to one paper accepted 
in the doctoral symposium track. Each accepted paper must be **presented in person** to be included in the 
proceedings, published by Springer and available via the SpringerLink Digital Library. The official publication date is when the 
proceedings are made available online by Springer.
