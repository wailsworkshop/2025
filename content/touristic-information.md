### History

Sardinia is among **Europe’s most geologically ancient land masses**. Humans started to live here at the end of the Paleolithic period, 
approximately 20-10,000 years ago. The prominent civilization flourished here from the 18th century BC until either 238 BC or the 2nd century 
AD in specific regions. During the ruling alliance period of the Nuragic Sardinians and the Phoenicians, some parts of islands were conquered by 
Carthage, and then later by Rome in 238 BC, which lasted for 700 years. In 1324, the Iberian Crown of Aragon took control of this island and 
consolidated it into the Kingdom of Sardinia. This Iberian kingdom lasted until 1718, when it was surrendered to the Alpine House of Savoy, the 
Savoyards expanded it to include the whole Italian peninsula and renamed it to “Kingdom of Italy” in 1861, and further in 1946 it was reconstituted 
as the present day “Italian republic”.

### Symbols

The **flag of Sardinia** was defined in the **Medieval period**, around the 14th century, during the Aragonese domination of Sardinia. 
It is said to have been inspired by the coat of arms of the King of Aragon, which depicted a golden shield with **four Moorish heads**. These four 
Moorish heads represent defeated enemies, and also reflect the island’s complex history and the spirit of its people. Over the centuries, 
the design of the flag underwent some modifications, with variations in the depiction of the Moors’ heads and the inclusion of other elements. 
The current version of the Sardinian flag was officially adopted on January 5, 1952. It became the **official flag** of the Autonomous Region of 
Sardinia after the region was granted special autonomy.
