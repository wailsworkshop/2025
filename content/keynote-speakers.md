**Title:**  
Beyond the Paradoxes of Artificial Intelligence in Education: Toward a Pedagogically Sustainable Human–Machine Cooperation  

**Abstract:**  
The integration of Artificial Intelligence into educational processes opens promising yet complex horizons, confronting pedagogy with a series of paradoxes: automation vs autonomy, mimesis vs trust, opacity vs transparency, efficiency vs reflexivity. These tensions reveal not only technological dilemmas but also epistemological and ethical questions about the meaning of learning and the role of the human in knowledge production. This presentation examines such paradoxes through the lenses of learning theories and critical pedagogy, proposing a framework for human–machine cooperation grounded in transparency, responsibility, and participation. In this view, AI does not replace but rather augments human intelligence, supporting educational practices that foster autonomy, creativity, and critical awareness. The goal is to outline a pedagogical horizon in which AI becomes not a technology of control but a space for co-construction, reflection, and shared meaning-making in learning.
