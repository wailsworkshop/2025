# Social Dinner

The social dinner for IIR 2025 will be held in Cagliari's city center. Details about the venue, menu, and cost will be announced closer to the conference date.

The social dinner provides an excellent opportunity to network with fellow researchers in a relaxed setting and enjoy the local cuisine of Sardinia.

## Cost

The social dinner will not be included in the registration fee and will require separate payment. We expect the price to be approximately 30-35â‚¬ per person, which will include a full dinner with drinks.

## Registration

Registration for the social dinner will be available along with the main conference registration in summer 2025.

## Location

The precise location will be announced closer to the event date, but it will be easily accessible from the main conference venue and hotels in the city center.
