### By Plane

### By Ferry

Getting to Sardinia by ferry is one of the two ways to reach the island and the only viable option if you are travelling with your own vehicle (car or motorbike). Travelling by ferry is usually the most common option for families with small children and is also very appreciated by people who are afraid to fly or can’t take a plane for whatever reason.

There are several companies that operate the ferry to Sardinia: Tirrenia, Grandi Navi Veloci, Moby, Grimaldi Lines, Corsica Ferries, among others. The island has six harbours directly linked to a dozen cities, both Italian and European. [Cagliari harbour](https://www.portuskaralis.com/en/) is located inside the city and is only 200 metres away from the bus and train station, making your trip to Sardinia very easy from the beginning. You can travel to Cagliari by ferry from Civitavecchia, Napoli, and Palermo. No ferries from outside Italy travel to Cagliari. For more information about the tickets and routes visit [this website](https://www.directferries.com/cagliari_ferry.htm).

You will have a choice of both day and night trips available to get to Sardinia: day trips are shorter (5 to 6.5 hours), as they are usually on fast ferries; while night trips take up to 10 or even 12 hours depending on your departure city and on the sea conditions, but you will have a chance to overnight in a cabin. All ferries have cabins, i.e., the most comfortable option if you are travelling overnight, and comfortable chairs for passengers. Moreover, there are a lot of common spaces such as restaurants, playgrounds for the kids and so on.

## Travel Essentials for Cagliari

### Weather Conditions

December in Cagliari, Sardinia, is characterised by mild and changeable weather, marking the heart of the island’s winter season. The temperatures during this time of the year typically range from around 9 to 16 degrees Celsius. Visitors can expect shorter days, with a mix of sunshine, cloud cover, and occasional rainfall. The sea temperature in December is cooler, averaging around 15 to 17 degrees Celsius, making swimming less common but still possible for the adventurous. Light winds and higher humidity levels contribute to a calm and sometimes brisk atmosphere.

While the weather is generally mild, it is advisable to bring warm layers, a light jacket or coat, and a small umbrella or raincoat to stay comfortable in varying conditions. December in Cagliari offers a unique opportunity for relaxed exploration, enjoying the city's cultural sites, and experiencing the festive charm of the winter season. The city’s holiday lights, quieter streets, and seasonal events create a warm and welcoming atmosphere. It is important to check weather forecasts in advance and dress appropriately to fully enjoy the beauty and activities that Cagliari has to offer during this month.

### Mobile Communication

As a member of the European Union, Italy facilitates seamless communication for travellers by allowing the use of European phone subscriptions without incurring roaming charges. This policy not only fosters economic collaboration and cultural exchange but also enhances the overall travel experience, offering a practical advantage to all business professionals attending the conference while immersed in the rich tapestry of Cagliari’s landscapes.

### Health Insurance

Prior to your arrival, individuals hailing from the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland are advised to obtain the European Health Insurance Card (commonly known as the blue card). This card ensures access to medical coverage in the event of an emergency. For those arriving from non-EU countries, it is advisable to inquire with their local insurance company or social security office before departure to ascertain whether any specific arrangements or provisions exist in collaboration with Italy.

### Driving License

While attending the conference, a driving licence will not be necessary. Nevertheless, you may find it beneficial to consider renting a car before or after the event for convenient exploration. Italy’s membership in the EU and EEA means that Italian driving licences align with Directive 2006/126/EC, essentially making them European driving licences. Hence, driving licences issued in the EEA are recognized and valid in Italy. This information can be particularly handy for those planning to explore the landscapes and cultural treasures of Sardinia at their own pace either preceding or following the conference.

### Monetary Transactions

The official currency in the area is the Euro, and local ATMs provide a convenient way to withdraw cash. It is advisable to carry a good amount of cash since not all establishments accept card payments. Generally, Visa, MasterCard, and Maestro are widely accepted, making electronic transactions accessible. However, be mindful that certain shops may impose a surcharge for card transactions under 5 euros. Therefore, having a mix of cash and cards ensures a flexible experience.

### Electric Connections

Italy adheres to the known European electrical standard, providing power at 220V to 230V with a frequency of 50Hz. The wall outlets are designed to accommodate plugs with either two or three round pins, the latter being grounded. To ensure your electronic devices can connect, it is recommended to check the compatibility of your plugs, as illustrated on the right or to come with an adaptor.

### Language Fundamentals

Italian, a Romance language within the Indo-European language family, traces its roots back to the Vulgar Latin of the Roman Empire. It shares its closest linguistic ties with Sardinian and stands out as the least divergent language from Latin. Currently spoken by approximately 85 million people (as of 2022), Italian holds official language status in Italy, San Marino, Switzerland (specifically Ticino and the Grisons), and serves as the primary language in Vatican City. As for significance, Italian ranks as a major language in Europe and stands as the second-most-widely spoken native language in the European Union, boasting 67 million speakers, which is 15% of the EU population. Furthermore, an additional 13.4 million EU citizens, or 3%, communicate proficiently in Italian as a second language.

While major cities in Sardinia often feature a good number of English speakers, making communication accessible for travellers, the effort to converse in Italian is well-received by locals. Attempting the local language, even with just a few basic words and phrases, can foster connections and enhance your experience, whether you are enjoying an aperitivo or immersing yourself in the lively atmosphere of a bustling piazza. To help you get started, some fundamental words and phrases include:

- “Goodbye/Hello = Ciao“
- “Good morning = Buongiorno“
- “Good evening = Buonasera“
- “Goodnight = Buonanotte (use this when you’re going to bed)“
- “Please = Per favore“
- “Thank you = Grazie“
- “Thanks so much = Grazie mille“
- “You’re welcome = Prego; Di niente“
- “Well = Bene“
- “Bad = Male“
- “Yes = Sì“
- “No = No“
- “Who? = Chi?“
- “What? = Che?; Cosa?“
- “Where? = Dove?“
- “When? = Quando?“
- “Why? = Perché?“
- “How much? = Quanto?“
- “How much does it cost? = Quanto costa?“
