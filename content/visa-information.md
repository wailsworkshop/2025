## Requirements

### Schengen Area
Italy is a member of the European Union and part of the Schengen Area â€“ a block of 27 European countries that comprise the largest border-free area on the planet. Therefore, visitors from other Schengen countries can enter Italy without a VISA. Around 60 countries outside the EU, including the UK, USA, Canada, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, New Zealand and Australia, are also granted VISA-free travel to Italy and other Schengen countries for a maximum of 90 days within any 180-day period. Your passport must be valid for at least three months after your intended departure date, and you may be required to show documentation justifying the reason for your stay and your date of departure. 

To see if your country is covered, use the questionnaire on the [Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs website](https://www.esteri.it/en/sportello_info/domandefrequenti/sezione_visti_entrare_in_italia/) or check the [European Commission website](http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/borders-and-visas/schengen/index_en.htm).

### Outside the Schengen Area
Travellers from all other countries require a Schengen VISA to enter Italy (and the wider Schengen area). Such countries include India, Pakistan, China, Egypt, Thailand, the Philippines and Rwanda. If required, VISAs should be applied for at the nearest Italian consulate in your country of origin. Documents needed include a recent passport-size photograph and a passport with an expiry date of at least three months longer than that of the visa requested. The website for your nearest Italian consulate will have details on how to book an appointment and make the application.
