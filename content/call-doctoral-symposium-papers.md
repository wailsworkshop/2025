## Introduction
The **2nd Workshop on Artificial Intelligence with and for Learning Sciences: Past, Present, and Future Horizons** 
(WAILS 2025) is a high-quality forum focused on achievements, challenges, solutions, and future perspectives concerned 
with the adoption of **artificial intelligence** methods and techniques in the context of **learning sciences**. Building on its 
successful inaugural edition, WAILS 2025 brings together researchers and practitioners working within academia, industry, and 
government, and coming from different fields such as computer science, education, cognitive science, economics, psychology, sociology, 
and human-computer interaction, with the goal of fostering a fruitful **dialogue across disciplines**. The accepted papers are going to 
be published by **Springer** into an **LNCS post-workshop proceedings volume**, and submitted for indexing to **DBLP**, **Google Scholar**, 
and **Scopus**. 

**Doctoral students** are invited to apply to **present their research** to experienced scholars who will provide constructive feedback and advice. 
Students are encouraged to participate if they are **at least six months from completing their dissertation** and have already **settled on a research 
area or dissertation topic**. This forum will provide students with an opportunity to: 
- Present and discuss their research ideas with experienced scholars. 
- Develop their research interests under the guidance of distinguished experts. 
- Explore career pathways available after completing the doctorate. 
- Network and build collaborations within the community.

Students are asked to submit a **brief proposal outlining their doctoral research**, which will be evaluated by the doctoral symposium committee. 
Each student with an accepted submission will be assigned a mentor who will provide feedback on the student’s work. A **mentoring session** will take 
place during the conference, and each student is expected to attend.

## Deadlines
- **Paper submission**: September 25, 2025
- **Notification**: October 23, 2025
- **Camera-ready submission**: November 6, 2025

Note: all the deadlines are at 11:59 pm [Anywhere on Earth (AoE)](https://time.is/Anywhere_on_Earth) time.

## Submission 

### Platform

Papers must be written in **English** and submitted electronically in a **PDF format**, through the **CMT submission system**, by selecting 
the **type** “Doctoral Symposium Paper”. The **link** to the submission system will be available soon. 

### Format

Consult the [WAILS 2025's call for full and short research papers](/2025/call-full-short-papers/) concerning the key topics of this call as well. 
Each proposal should be a single PDF document, with three required components, here detailed:
- **Letter of recommendation** (from your primary dissertation advisor, in any format): 
  - Describe your interaction with the student and your assessment of the quality of their work. Explain how the WAILS 2025 doctoral symposium would benefit this student at this point in their doctoral program, as well as the contributions you expect the student to make to the group. 
  - The doctoral symposium targets students who have a clear idea of their research plans and have started their research but have not yet executed a majority of their research. Please explain the structure of your student’s program and their expected level of progress. 
  - Recall that students who are unable to obtain a letter of recommendation from their dissertation advisor (or the equivalent) should instead include a short explanation and a description of where the student is in their doctoral progress and the anticipated timeline.
- **Research description** (6 pages at most; references, figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgments, and any other content count toward the page limit). Please use the Springer's single-column manuscript format as specified in the guidelines, and ensure that your submission includes the following components:
  - Your name, advisor(s) name(s), and your affiliation. 
  - Current year of study and projected completion date. 
  - Context and motivation for your research. 
  - Key related work that frames your research. 
  - Specific research objectives, goals, or questions. 
  - Research approach, methods, and rationale. 
  - Results and contributions to date. 
  - Expected next steps. 
  - Dissertation status and long-term goals.
- **Curriculum vitae** (2 pages at most, in any format). Provide a concise summary of your current curriculum vitae, highlighting your research publications. Clearly distinguish between published papers and those currently under review or in press.

Please ensure that your submission is **complete** and **conforms to the format and content guidelines** above. 
Submissions that do not meet these requirements will be desk-rejected.

### Templates

The doctoral students should submit the **research description** for review in the **Springer single-column format**. Templates are given below:
- [Latex](https://resource-cms.springernature.com/springer-cms/rest/v1/content/19238648/data/v8)
- [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/springer-lecture-notes-in-computer-science/kzwwpvhwnvfj)
- [Word](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://resource-cms.springernature.com/springer-cms/rest/v1/content/19238706/data/v5__;!!D9dNQwwGXtA!QassVui7ZN89lpQ-D7Y0u8JlGG89njKTrifZIdMWKXRkLszHuZKIFGLnmedhPj65oYOndDs5axD7BB3Xo9PVerEJD_woooW5_A$)

### Non-anonymity

Submissions will be reviewed under a **single-blind process**; thus, authors **are not required to anonymize** their manuscripts 
before uploading them.

### Non-dual policy 

There is **no dual submission policy**, which is why submitted manuscripts **must not** be simultaneously under review nor submitted for 
review elsewhere whilst under consideration for this workshop. A violation of this concurrent submission policy will be deemed a **serious 
infraction** of scientific ethics, and appropriate measures will be implemented in response.

### Ethical and human subjects considerations 

Submissions are expected to include a discussion of **ethical considerations**, as well as the **impact** of the presented work and/or its 
intended application, where appropriate. The authors are expected to comply with **ethical standards** and **regulatory guidelines** 
associated with **human subjects research**, including research involving human participants and research using personally identifiable data. 
Submissions reporting on such human subjects research must include a statement identifying any regulatory review the research is subject to or explaining the lack of required review.

## Camera-Ready Submission 

The accepted proposals (i.e., **the research description component**) will be submitted to the Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LCNS) 
and must be compliant with the guidelines provided by the LCNS. The accepted proposals will require a further revision in order to **meet the 
requirements and the page limits of the camera-ready format** required by Springer. Instructions for the preparation of the camera-ready versions 
of the papers will be provided after acceptance. We strongly recommend the usage of LaTeX/Overleaf for the camera-ready papers to minimize 
the extent of reformatting. Users of the Word template must use either the version for Microsoft Word for Windows, Macintosh Office 2011, or 
Macintosh Office 2016 (other formats such as Open Office, etc., are not admitted) for the camera-ready submission to avoid incompatibility issues. 
Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers. In addition, the **corresponding author** of each paper, acting on behalf of all 
of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a consent-to-publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match 
the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship are not allowed. 
Instructions for preparing the camera-ready versions of accepted papers will be provided **after acceptance**. Camera-ready versions of accepted 
papers will be submitted via CMT.

## Registration and Presentation Policy 

Each accepted doctoral symposium paper must be accompanied by a **full author registration**, completed by the **early registration deadline**. 
Please kindly note that a single registration covers up to one paper accepted in the full or short paper track, and up to one paper accepted 
in the doctoral symposium track. Each accepted doctoral symposium paper must be **presented in person** to be included in the 
proceedings, published by Springer and available via the SpringerLink Digital Library. The official publication date is when the 
proceedings are made available online by Springer.
